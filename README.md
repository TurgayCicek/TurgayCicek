# 👋 Hi, I'm Turgay — HVAC + AI Technician

I’m an early-career technician developing global-level fundamentals in  
**HVAC systems, Building Automation (BMS), BACnet**, and **AI-supported energy optimization**.

My long-term mission is to build a **world-class skillset** by combining:
- HVAC field knowledge  
- Building controls & communication protocols  
- Smart-building automation  
- Energy modeling tools  
- AI-assisted diagnostics and optimization  

This GitHub profile documents my entire learning journey from  
**EPA 608 ➝ BMS ➝ BACnet ➝ BrainBox AI ➝ EnergyPlus ➝ HVAC-AI (2026–2030)**.
